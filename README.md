# LUGX Gaming

LUGX Gaming is an online gaming shop based on the design from [TemplateMo](https://templatemo.com/tm-589-lugx-gaming). This project implements the frontend and a backend API to analyze website data and present it on a visualization dashboard.

## üöÄ Overview

This project is a microservices-based application for an online gaming store. It includes a frontend for the user interface, a service to manage games, and a service to handle orders.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Frontend:** A responsive and visually appealing user interface for browsing and purchasing games.
*   **Game Service:** Manages the game catalog, including adding, updating, and retrieving game information.
*   **Order Service:** Handles the purchasing process, including creating and managing orders.
*   **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualizes website data to provide insights into user behavior and sales trends.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built using a microservices architecture, with separate services for the frontend, games, and orders. This design allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each service.

*   **Frontend:** The frontend is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is served by a containerized web server.
*   **Game Service:** A Python Flask application that provides a RESTful API for managing games.
*   **Order Service:** A Python Flask application that provides a RESTful API for managing orders.
